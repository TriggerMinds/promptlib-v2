# Environment Variables for PromptLibrary
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values (if needed)

# Currently, the application runs fully with mock data and localStorage.
# No external API keys are required.

# If you later integrate a real backend (e.g., Supabase), uncomment and set these:

# SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# If you integrate a real LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini):
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# For deployment, you may also set:
# VITE_APP_TITLE="PromptLibrary"
# VITE_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Note: Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the client-side code.
# Do not store secrets in client-side exposed variables.
